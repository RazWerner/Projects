# Clock Domain Crossing FIFO
This project implements a Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) FIFO on the ICEbreaker FPGA board, developed in git Codespaces. Itâ€™s designed to safely transfer data between two clock domains, a critical function in digital systems where different parts operate at different clock speeds.
